summary: Smoke test
description: Import project main module in python.
contact: Jiri Konecny <jkonecny@redhat.com>
duration: 10m
framework: shell
path: /
test: python3 -c "import initial_setup"

# Make this `path` adjustment only when we are in the Packit environement.
# Packit will install RPM of this package and we should test on that. By
# changing the `path` attribute we are changing also local PYTHONPATH, so
# we won't be testing local ``initial_setup`` directory.
adjust:
  path: /data
  when: trigger == code
